# Project 1

In Project 1 the assignment called for analyzing data within the world of baseball. We were given the complete MLB baseball dateset and were told to create a series of functions that gave us an intuition into using libraries like numpy and pandas. The end result was a better understanding of baseball and what it means to "data mine"
